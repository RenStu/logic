\section{Logic}
According to the online English dictionary Collins\cite{dic_logic}, the word logic refers to:
	\begin{enumerate}
	   \item The system and \underline{principles of reasoning} used in a specific field of study;
	   \item The \underline{relationship and interdependence of a series} of events, facts, etc; 
	   \item Necessary connection or outcome, as through the working of \underline{cause and effect}. 
	\end{enumerate}
 
\bigbreak
The word logic or any of its principles or expressions, classical or non-classical, express a cause and consequence relationship or chained facts. Movement, change and transition can be distinguished as the essence of the above definitions. The word logic, in its essence, fits perfectly with the definition of nothing - [NOT BEING].  Logic is centered on change and change is centered on that which [IS NOT], since that which [is] (being), cannot cease to be in order to transform. Change requires that at some point something ceases to be what it was in order to be transformed. In \citeonline{parmenides} Parmenides, the philosopher of the unity and identity of being, says that continuous change is the main characteristic of [NOT BEING]. For Parmenides the [being] is one (singular), eternal, ungenerated, and unchanging.

In this duality, existence is based on logic, which [IS NOT - NEGATES ITSELF], while [is - being] illogical, immutable and non-existent. In this way, [being] limits existence by defining the non-existent, the immutable and the illogical while [IS NOT] \textit{ad infinitum}.

In Figure \ref{fig:primordial_logic_representation}, the straight-line analogy is used to facilitate reasoning. Based on this Figure, the following observations (axioms) can be extracted in relation to the points \textbf {0}, \textbf {1} and the \textbf{interval} between them:
	\begin{description}
	   \item[Point 1 - {[1,1]}] It is illogical, as it is the unfractionated total of the straight-line, in this case the primordial premise of the logic [NOT BEING] was not met. 
	   \item[Point 0 - {[0,0]}] It is illogical, since it is a null point incapable of denying itself. All logic or sublogic (logical fraction) must continue to deny itself, since this is the primordial premise of logic. Logic [IS NOT] in its essence, primordially.
	   \item[Interval - $\textbf{{]0,1[}}$] The logic is only possible in the fractional representation of the line, that is, between the interval of the points \textbf{0} and \textbf{1}. A fraction of the line denies being the line, since it is only a part of it. Subintervals, in the same way, are also capable of infinite negate themselves, guaranteeing the primordial premise of logic (negation of itself) in the interval and its subintervals.
	\end{description}

Probably, these axioms or features of primordial logic (the essence of everything and by consequence of this study) are the foundations of the basic cognitive processes that have supported and continue to support, for example, the creation and development of numbers. The logic's negations to itself form a logical expansion that represents changes or inequalities. These inequalities (differences) can be represented by symbols of a language, and numbers are a convenient cognitive abstraction for this representation.

The initial, final and intermediate points represented in the straight line in the Figure \ref{fig:primordial_logic_representation} are consonant with the natural numbers, readjusting the scale of the symbols that represent each logical moment as needed for the expansion. They are also consonant with positive real numbers, those represented without operations, such as fractions, roots and others (finite decimals).

In Figure \ref{fig:first_logical_moment} the joining of the dash to the straight line is the representation of a logical negation (logical moment). From the negation of the logic in [be] arise these two logical subintervals or two sublogics (intervals of the straight line). In this first logical moment, the segment in blue represents the negation of the logic in [be] the illogical whole (the straight line). In the second logical moment, the two subintervals of the straight line or sublogic are able to negate themselves, guaranteeing the primary premise of logic, [NOT BE] infinitely. In Figure \ref{fig:third_logical_moment} a logical expansion with the first three logical moments is shown.

The logical essence [NOT BEING] is analogous to an abstract constant, that is, its infinite negations and subnegations transcend time. All these infinite negations take place in the absence of time. The inability of logic to negates itself, even for a small interval, would make logic [be] illogical in that interval, which would break the primordial premise of logic, [NOT BEING]. Logic is like an algorithm composed only of a self-executing constant, a generalized recursion and infinite, a simultaneous sequence. The experience of time is driven by consciousness, not by the simultaneous nature of the sequence, but by the order of that sequence, which is nothing more than the observation of the order of the changes of each logical moment.

It is simpler to visualize this simultaneous sequence by imagining a horizontal bar in black $\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare$. This bar is formed by infinite black vertical slices or lines. So there are infinite ways to negate the first logical moment and each infinitesimal slice of the bar will be the beginning of a different sequence or expansion. When determining any of the slices for the first logical moment, immediately all other slices of the population (in the left and right ranges of the chosen slice) are different expansions for the second logical moment, and so on. In other words, expansions are generalizations, and there is no slash range that has not already been negated for any logical moment.

So this simultaneous sequence is an infinite and generalized recursion in the absence of time, the best definition of constant, which according to the English online dictionary Collins\cite{dic_constant}, is something that repeats itself continuously, uninterruptedly and permanently, something unalterable.
