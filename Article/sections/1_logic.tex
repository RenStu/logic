\section{Logic}
According to the online English dictionary Collins\cite{dic_logic}, the word logic refers to:
	\begin{enumerate}
	   \item The system and \underline{principles of reasoning} used in a specific field of study;
	   \item The \underline{relationship and interdependence of a series} of events, facts, etc; 
	   \item Necessary connection or outcome, as through the working of \underline{cause and effect}. 
	\end{enumerate}
 
\bigbreak
The word logic or any of its principles or expressions, classical or non-classical, express a cause and consequence relationship or chained facts. Movement, change and transition can be distinguished as the essence of the above definitions. The word logic, in its essence, fits perfectly with the definition of nothing - [NOT BEING].  Logic is centered on change and change is centered on that which [IS NOT], since that which [is] (being), cannot cease to be in order to transform. Change requires that at some point something ceases to be what it was in order to be transformed. In \citeonline{parmenides} Parmenides, the philosopher of the unity and identity of being, says that continuous change is the main characteristic of [NOT BEING]. For Parmenides the [being] is one (singular), eternal, ungenerated, and unchanging.

In this duality, existence is based on logic, which [IS NOT] - negates itself, while [is - being] illogical, immutable and non-existent. In this way, [being] limits existence by determining the non-existent, the immutable and the illogical while [IS NOT] \textit{ad infinitum} indeterminately.

NOTHING is a constant indetermination guaranteed by the circular constant [NOT BEING]. The circular part of the constant determines its simultaneity. Therefore, this circular constant [NOT BEING] is synonymous of the infinite, which is a repetition of itself that denies to be guaranteed the transient simultaneity of indetermination. Although the infinite mirrors a transient simultaneity, its real nature is constant, like the intervals of a line segment, for example, which are indeterminable and simultaneously transient when they tend to infinity, even though they represent a constant unit.

In Figure \ref{fig:primordial_logic_representation}, the straight-line analogy is used to facilitate reasoning. Based on this Figure, the following observations (axioms) can be extracted in relation to the points \textbf {0}, \textbf {1} and the \textbf{interval} between them:
	\begin{description}
	   \item[Point 1 - {[1,1]}] It is illogical, as it is the unfractionated total of the straight-line, in this case the primordial premise of the logic [NOT BEING] was not met. 
	   \item[Point 0 - {[0,0]}] It is illogical, since it is a null point incapable of denying itself. All logic or sublogic (logical fraction) must continue to deny itself, since this is the primordial premise of logic. Logic [IS NOT] in its essence, primordially.
	   \item[Interval - $\textbf{{]0,1[}}$] The logic is only possible in the fractional representation of the line, that is, between the interval of the points \textbf{0} and \textbf{1}. A fraction of the line denies being the line, since it is only a part of it. Subintervals, in the same way, are also capable of infinite negate themselves, guaranteeing the primordial premise of logic (negation of itself) in the interval and its subintervals.
	\end{description}

Probably, these axioms or features of primordial logic (the essence of everything and by consequence of this study) are the foundations of the basic cognitive processes that have supported and continue to support, for example, the creation and development of numbers. The logic's negations to itself form a logical expansion that represents changes or inequalities. These inequalities (differences) can be represented by symbols of a language, and numbers are a convenient cognitive abstraction for this representation.

The initial, final and intermediate points represented in the straight line in the Figure \ref{fig:primordial_logic_representation} are consonant with the natural numbers, readjusting the scale of the symbols that represent each logical moment as needed for the expansion. They are also consonant with positive real numbers, those represented without operations, such as fractions, roots and others (finite decimals).

In Figure \ref{fig:first_logical_moment} the joining of the dash to the straight line is the representation of a logical negation (logical moment). From the negation of the logic in [be] arise these two logical subintervals or two sublogics (intervals of the straight line). In this first logical moment, the segment in blue represents the negation of the logic in [be] the illogical whole (the straight line). In the second logical moment, the two subintervals of the straight line or sublogic are able to negate themselves, guaranteeing the primary premise of logic, [NOT BE] infinitely. In Figure \ref{fig:third_logical_moment} a logical expansion with the first three logical moments is shown.

The logical essence [NOT BEING] is analogous to an abstract constant, that is, its infinite negations and subnegations transcend time. All these infinite negations take place in the absence of time. The inability of logic to negates itself, even for a small interval, would make logic [be] illogical in that interval, which would break the primordial premise of logic, [NOT BEING]. The circular constant [NOT BEING] represents an infinite and generalized negation.

It is simpler to visualize this generalized and infinite recursion by imagining a horizontal bar in black $\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare\!\blacksquare$. This bar is formed by infinite black vertical slices or lines. So there are infinite ways to negate the first logical moment and each infinitesimal slice of the bar will be the beginning of a different sequence or expansion. When determining any of the slices for the first logical moment, immediately all other slices of the population (in the left and right ranges of the chosen slice) are different expansions for the second logical moment, and so on. In other words, expansions are generalizations, and there is no slash range that has not already been negated for any logical moment.

This generalized infinite recursion in the absence of time is the best definition of a constant, the best definition of constant, which according to the English online dictionary Collins\cite{dic_constant}, is something that repeats itself continuously, uninterruptedly and permanently, something unalterable.

The experience of time is conducted by the consciousness, a specific and non-generalized expansion. Time is not a quantity related to the simultaneous nature of this generalized and infinite recursion, but rather by the order or sequence of each specific expansion, which is nothing more than the observation of the order of the changes of each logical moment of the expansion. \textbf{This order of each logical moment only makes sense in particular expansions, because when generalized the primordial logic [NOT BE] is a transcendent constant that mirrors or represents the infinite possibilities of a probabilistic n x n matrix}. The Time subsection shows more details in this regard.

In the universe of logic, its possibilities create and underlie existence, that is, if logic is possible then it exists. The essential logic determines the possible and the impossible and with it existence and non-existence. This logic represents infinity. For logic, a possibility is the determination of a path and consequently the existence of that path. Therefore, the infinite is determined in its possibilities, regardless of human logic illusory dividing the concrete and the abstract. As much as a logic represents movement, it is essentially constant, like an algorithm. What characterizes logic is change, more specifically the possibility of change, thus several changes in a common direction or path determine a logic. The negation of self of primordial logic is an example of this path, since it is the representation of a circular constant, the circularity being the part that determines the path. The circularity of this constant sustains with foundation and coherence the indefinite characteristic of [NOT BEING]. Ultimately, nothingness is a logical constant that represents the indefinite (the infinite) and therefore is an indefinite constant.

From the primordial logic [NOT BEING] new logical patterns emerge.
