This is a study of primordial logic that resulted in a theory about the origin of everything. All lines of reasoning in this study can be deepened and detailed.

Eventually it can be considered a philosophical and/or scientific study, however the basis of these two important branches is logic, the core of this theory. 

The answer to the central question of this study (if there is something rather than nothing) comes from logic. The study of logic has given rise to a theory about the origin of all things. This theory answers what consciousness, waves, infinity, time, space, fundamental forces, dark matter, dark energy, antimatter, the black hole and the observer/life are.

May the model of this study be the beginning of a new era. An era where the human being can develop himself and see that he is the host of infinity. May this evolution turn dreams into reality and may it be possible to observe that reality is no different from a dream, since both are just logical.

The idea that something physical came out of nothing is inconsistent with the nature of nothing.
