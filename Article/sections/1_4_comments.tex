\subsection{Observations}
	\begin{description}
	   \item[Core] The negation of logic to itself (nothingness) gave rise to three axioms that are the basis of the core theorem of this theory and the basis for existence. This theorem gives rise to waves and their main attribute, wave entanglement.
	   \item[Logical rigidity] If physical rigidity and its laws seem insurmountable, below it is logic, even more rigid and insurmountable, because outside logic is the non-existent, the illogical. Existence is contained in the possibilities of what is logical. 
	   \item[Mathematics] Logic in its essence is not subject to mathematics, but all mathematics is restricted to logic, and therefore some of its simplest constructions may come closer to essential logic than others.
	   \item[Biology] Perhaps this study can deepen or help to clarify the so-called horizontal gene transfer, since the probability of sampling distribution in subintervals with spatial or temporal approximations can make them share similarities in their developmental patterns.
	   \item[Good and evil] Good and evil depend on the observer and are only valid possibilities among infinite others. Perhaps the greatest justice of the universe or logic is the non-exclusion of any path or possibilities. That is, if it is light, negation tends to darken, if it is hot to cool, etc. It is the struggle of opposites of Heraclitus of Ephesus. 
	   \item[Perfection] The primordial logic is the simplest logic, it is the essence of existence. A logic as simple as it is efficient, as efficient as it is perfect:
	   \begin{description}
		   \item[Omnipotent] The essence of all logical possibilities, that is, the essence of existence, because outside of logical possibilities is the illogical, the non-existent;
		   \item[Omniscient] Flow of all logical abstractions from consciousness to the subconsciousnesses; 
		   \item[Omnipresent] Its fractions (negations) are in all existence.
	   \end{description}
	These remarks refer to God, the consciousness of subconsciousnesses. Ultimately, God is Logic, from its infinitesimal and fundamental negation of itself to its infinite greatness. God is love, therefore, the order or attraction that is present in all scales of existence.
	   \item[Equality] Equality is infinitely improbable in the universe. Difference is the key to life. As an example, racism (predominance of one social or ethnic group) is a form of equality because it does not accept the other groups. Trying to level society in all its aspects is also a form of equality because it does not accept the variations it can have. Even in the Bible there was a fight for equality, since Jesus, being God (trinity), accepted and said that the father is greater than Him, however, the fallen angel wanted to be equal to God and was expelled by Michael, whose name means "Who is like God?" or "there is none like God". With these observations it is clear that to compromise with the disrespect for differences is to compromise against life, because to respect life is to love and protect its diversity. The more diversity the richer life is, therefore, to live or let live in situations that oppose love, when there are conditions contrary to this, is a disrespect to life because it threatens its diversity.
	   \item[Reality] As a logical possibility, the dream is as real as "reality". Perhaps the study of logical possibilities leads to paths where dreams can be as real as reality, since both are just logic, like lucid dreams, for example \cite{lucid_dreams}.  This may explain why other possible forms of "intelligent" life, when evolved, stop looking for this kind of life in a possible vast universe and look within themselves, where something much larger than the universe can be found, infinite.
	   \item[Convergence] Quantum jump and entanglement are some of the behaviors that already challenge the physical world, and may be the point of convergence with this new paradigm.
