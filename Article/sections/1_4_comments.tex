\subsection{Observations}
	\begin{description}
	   \item[Core] The negation of logic to itself (nothingness) gave rise to three axioms that are the basis of the core theorem of this theory and the basis for existence. This theorem gives rise to waves and their main attribute, wave entanglement.
	   \item[Logical rigidity] If physical rigidity and its laws seem insurmountable, below it is logic, even more rigid and insurmountable, because outside logic is the non-existent, the illogical. Existence is contained in the possibilities of what is logical. 
	   \item[Mathematics] Logic in its essence is not subject to mathematics, but all mathematics is restricted to logic, and therefore some of its simplest constructions may come closer to essential logic than others.
	   \item[Good and evil] Good and evil depend on the observer and are only valid possibilities among infinite others. Perhaps the greatest justice of the universe or logic is the non-exclusion of any path or possibilities. That is, if it is light, negation tends to darken, if it is hot to cool, etc. It is the struggle of opposites of Heraclitus of Ephesus. 
	   \item[Perfection] The primordial logic is the simplest logic, it is the essence of existence. A logic as simple as it is efficient, as efficient as it is perfect:
	   \begin{description}
		   \item[Omnipotent] The essence of all logical possibilities, that is, the essence of existence, because outside of logical possibilities is the illogical, the non-existent;
		   \item[Omniscient] Flow of all logical abstractions from consciousness to the subconsciousnesses; 
		   \item[Omnipresent] Its fractions (negations) are in all existence.
	   \end{description}
	These remarks refer to God, the consciousness of subconsciousnesses. Ultimately, God is Logic, from its infinitesimal and fundamental negation of itself to its infinite greatness. God is love, and the essence of love is attraction, which is also present in the fundamental "forces".
	   \item[Reality] As a logical possibility, the dream is as real as "reality". Perhaps the study of logical possibilities leads to paths where dreams can be as real as reality, since both are just logic, like lucid dreams, for example \cite{lucid_dreams}.  This may explain why other possible forms of "intelligent" life, when evolved, stop looking for this kind of life in a possible vast universe and look within themselves, where something much larger than the universe can be found, infinite.
	   \item[Convergence] Quantum leap and entanglement are some of the behaviors that already challenge the physical world, and may be the point of convergence with this new paradigm.
