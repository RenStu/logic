# ‚ôæÔ∏è Logic, Logic Only - a [theory](#download-the-full-paper) about everything (overview)

According to the online English dictionary [Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/logic), the word logic refers to:

1. The system and <u>principles of reasoning</u> used in a specific field of study;
2. The <u>relationship and interdependence of a series</u> of events, facts, etc;
3. Necessary connection or outcome, as through the working of <u>cause and effect</u>.

The word logic, in its essence, fits perfectly with the definition of nothing - [NOT BEING]. Logic is centered on change and change is centered on that which [IS NOT], since that which [is] (being), cannot cease to be in order to transform. Change requires that at some point something ceases to be what it was in order to be transformed. In [Palmer (2020)](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/parmenides/) Parmenides, the philosopher of the unity and identity of being, says that continuous change is the main characteristic of [NOT BEING]. For Parmenides the [being] is one - singular, eternal, ungenerated, and unchanging.

## [Axioms](#axioms-of-primordial-logic) of primordial logic

<p align="center">Primordial Logic analogy</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="/Article/sections/images/primordial_logic_representation.jpg">
</p>
<p align="center">Line used to represent and validate the concept of primordial logic.</p>

In Figure above, the straight-line analogy is used to facilitate reasoning. Based on this Figure, the following observations ***(axioms)*** can be extracted in relation to the points **0**,  **1** and the **interval** between them:

- **Point 1 - [1,1]** - It is illogical, as it is the unfractionated total of the straight-line, in this case the primordial premise of the logic [NOT BEING] was not met.

- **Point 0 - [0,0]** - It is illogical, since it is a null point incapable of denying itself. All logic or sublogic (logical fraction) must continue to deny itself, since this is the primordial  premise of logic. Logic [IS NOT] in its essence, primordially.

- **Interval - ]0,1[** - The logic is only possible in the fractional representation of the line, that is, between the interval of the points 0 and 1. A fraction of the line denies being the line, since it is only a part of it. Subintervals, in the same way, are also capable of infinite negate themselves, guaranteeing the primordial premise of logic (negation of itself) in the interval and its subintervals.

## [Theorem](#theorem)

Primordial logic (negation of self) creates infinite logical expansions. A logical expansion is analogous to a universe. The first logical moment is the beginning of one of these expansions, but there are infinite possibilities of negation of the first logical moment, which reveals infinite logical expansions.

<p align="center">First logical moment</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="/Article/sections/images/first_logical_moment.jpg">
</p>
<p align="center">Fractionated line in two intervals representing the first logical moment.</p>

In Figure above the joining of the dash to the straight line is the representation of a logical negation (logical moment). From the negation of the logic in [be] arise these two logical subintervals or two sublogics (intervals of the straight line). In this first logical moment, the segment in blue represents the negation of the logic in [be] the illogical whole (the straight line).

<p align="center">
<img width="55%" src="/Article/sections/images/third_logical_moment.jpg">
</p>
<p align="center">Example of the first three moments of an expansion.</p>

- **First logical moment** The negation of the primordial logic to itself, subdivides it into two units, two sublogics. Although these parts have different proportions, they express the same amounts of points or possibilities of change, since they are representations of the primordial logic, which ad infinitum. The fractional part in blue represents the proportion of the logical negation to its unity.
- **Second logical moment** It is generated by the negation of the two primordial sublogics fractionated in the first logical moment, that is, the second logical moment is a negation of the first. In the impossibility of these sublogics continuing to negate themselves, even for a brief instant, would make them unable to negate their two units of the whole and consequently to make it [be]. The fractional parts in blue represent the proportion of the logical negation to their respective units.
- **Third logical moment** It follows from the negation of the second logical moment, just as the second logical moment follows from the negation of the first, and so on.

Based on the [axioms of primordial logic](#axioms of primordial logic), the following theorem is discriminated: If the parts of the subintervals are subparts of the entire interval, then these subparts summed are part of the entire interval.

Thus, in Figure below, the negation of the first logical moment negates [being], while the subnegations of the other logical moments are subparts that subnegate [being], so these subparts only negate [being] when added together or unified according to the first logical moment.

<p align="center">Example of the first two unified moments of an expansion.</p>

The unity present in the negation (first logical moment) and in the logical subnegations (other logical moments) is the characteristic that corresponds to the central axis of the central limit theorem. This theorem states that the sample distribution of a population approaches a normal distribution as the sample sizes increase, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This is especially true for sample sizes greater than 30. A simple test that demonstrates this fact is the rolling of unbiased dice. The higher the dice roll number, the more likely the graph will look like the normal distribution graph [(GLEN, 2019)](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/normal-distributions/central-limit-theorem-definition-examples/).

The blue arrows in the graph below (range of 99,99% of the total samples in the median), will be getting closer and closer to the center of the graph proportionally. Although the its amount increases, the proportion it has in (total samples) decreases. The purple arrows in the graph represent the (total samples). This graph represents 20 runs (100 samples to 2000 samples), with an increment of 100 samples in each run. That is, this theorem reflects a concentration of samples towards the median of the population, ***a probabilistic path***.

This work will treat the words logical moment as the unified logical moment from now on.

## What is nothing?

The logical essence [NOT BEING] is analogous to an abstract constant, that is, its infinite negations and subnegations transcend time. All these infinite negations take  place in the absence of time. The inability of logic to negates itself, even for a small interval, would make logic [be] illogical in that interval, which would break the primordial premise of logic, [NOT BEING]. Logic is like an algorithm composed only of a self-executing constant, a infinite and generalized recursion, a simultaneous sequence.

It is simpler to visualize this simultaneous sequence by imagining a vertical bar  **‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ** . This bar is formed by infinite black vertical slices or lines. So there are infinite ways to negate the first logical moment and each infinitesimal slice of the bar will be the beginning of a different sequence or expansion. When determining any of the slices for the first logical moment, immediately all other slices of the population (in the left and right ranges of the chosen slice) are different expansions for the second logical moment, and so on. In other words, expansions are generalizations, and there is no slash range that has not already been negated for any logical moment.

So this simultaneous sequence is an infinite and generalized recursion in the absence of time ()the best definition of constant) which according to the English online dictionary [Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/constant), is something that repeats itself continuously, uninterruptedly and permanently, something unalterable.

## What are waves?

Probabilistically, the distribution of new samples from a population tends to concentrate more samples toward the median of the population as the frequency of samples increases in this direction. However, the distribution of these samples with uniform growth frequencies is infinitesimal compared to the random possibilities of this growth. Thus, the tendency of these growth frequencies toward the median, together with the very low (infinitesimal) probability of this growth being uniform, leads to frequencies in the waveform.

<p align="center">Waveform</p>
<p align="center">
<img width="50%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_waves.jpg">
</p>
<p align="center">Wave pattern inferred by the trend of this distribution with higher frequencies towards the population median and very low probability of uniform growth of these frequencies.</p>

The most similar samples in terms of frequency and distribution are the samples that are part of the same wave. They are non-overlapping, opposite frequencies that complete each other.

Probabilistically, the two complementary parts of a wave tend to be at approximately equal distances, equidistant from the median, but this is not a rule and the complementary parts of a wave may be at different distances from the median. The phenomenon of parity of the parts of a wave is called ***wave entanglement***.

Intervals with similar temporal frequencies and spatial distributions are intervals formed by the same ***probabilistic unit***, that is, intervals that have the same probabilistic scenario or context at a given logical moment. Being in the same probabilistic scenario (probabilistic units), these intervals have their samples in the same space-time scenario, which is called space-time lattice and is formed by the largest probabilistic unit in the population (all the samples in the population intermediated by the median).

These entanglements form smaller waves, similar to the largest wave in the entire interval, usually entangled by the population median.

<p align="center">Smaller waves</p>
<p align="center">
<img width="50%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_subconscious.jpg">
</p>
<p align="center">The wave pattern forms smaller waves similar to the pattern created by largest wave in the entire interval.</p>

The length and amplitude of waves establish a quantity-per-interval or unit relationship. These units are established by wave entanglement.

The jump is a reordering done by wave entanglement, as the samples of the entangled pairs are no longer equivalent with the addition of new samples from one side of the pair. The jump occurs on one side of a pair of waves and is a reordering, that is, both the part of the interval that has just received the new sample must better match the intended interval for the jump, as well as the reverse.

In large intervals with many logical moments a smaller discrepancy of wave amplitudes is observed. In such intervals large systems of objects can be observed. The larger the intervals, the more balanced they grow towards the population median (probabilistically). Wave systems can be complex, having several nested waves. More complex intervals with this feature can represent, for example, the universe, then galaxies, stars, planets, etc.

<img width="30%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_space_subconsciousness.jpg">
</p>
<p align="center">Smaller wave discrepancy at large intervals.</p>

In smaller intervals and with many logical moments a greater discrepancy in wave amplitudes is observed. In these intervals smaller object systems can be observed. The smaller the intervals are, the more unbalanced they will grow towards the population median (probabilistically). More complex wave systems with this feature can represent, for example, the atom, which is very small, present in huge quantities, and the particles orbiting its nucleus (electrons) are much more distant from it.

## What is time?

Time is the addition of new logical moments between existing moments as the self-negation of primordial logic proceeds. The changes are cumulative and as the number of logical moments increases, the less relevant each new moment within the conscious interval will be. One in a hundred is more relevant than one in a thousand.

<p align="center">Time</p>
<p align="center">
<img width="55%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_time.jpg">
</p>
<p align="center">Progression of time as logical moments advance.</p>

Each population has a different order in its sequence and it is this order that gives rise to the logical quantity called time. It is this order of the universe that will give the notion of what happens before or after, that is, the past, the present and the probabilistic future prospections.

Another important factor when observing time is that, probabilistically, intervals closer to the population median will have a larger addition of new samples in their intervals. On the other hand, intervals far from the population median will have a smaller addition of samples in their intervals. This phenomenon of temporal observation provided by the probability of the population distribution avoids the twin paradox [(PERKOWITZ, 2013)](https://www.britannica.com/science/twin-paradox).

The ability to compare or distinguish the order of changes in a sequence of samples is the logical ability of an observer, the observer of time (past and present).The speed of this observation is given by the range that the observer is able to compare, that is, how quickly the observer is able to distinguish small changes (few samples - few logical moments) will make it realize that larger changes take longer (many samples - many logical moments).

The logical ability to make probabilistic prospections, within the logical limitations of the observer and based on the probability of distribution of the observed interval or subinterval, is the essence of thinking and, therefore, of life. These prospections are based on the probability of distribution of each interval (in the direction of the interval) and, therefore, are related to pattern detection and future probabilistic possibilities.

## What is space?

In Figure below, the sample density of a population is shown, where pairs tending to the same probabilistic distribution are placed side by side and represented in histogram form. The formation of these pairs comes from wave entanglement.

<p align="center">Entangled pairs represented in three spatial dimensions</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">Example of entangled waves, represented in histogram form and obtained by the <a href="https://github.com/RenStu/logic/blob/en-us/Algorithm/Logic_WavePattern.linq">Logic_WavePattern</a> algorithm.</p>

By plotting the spatial dimensions of the graph of Figure above on a 3D distribution graph and distributing their endpoints (neglecting their volumes and possible internal points), something like a spiral is obtained (like eddies in water or air), even on very small data volumes (few logical moments), as in Figure below. The points tend to move in a spiral shape approximately.

<p align="center">3D scatter plots</p>
<p align="center">
<img width="40%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_space_3DScatter_200000-2.jpg">
</p>
<p align="center">200,000 samples or moments.</p>

Another important factor is the higher concentration of samples tend to be distributed at the peak of the subinterval, because the top of the subintervals or wavelengths that form the peak (histogram columns that form the highest point of the wave) are closer to the population median than the bottom of those wavelengths, as shown in the example in Figure below in its center column in blue. The peak is the most easily visible part of an interval, probabilistically.

<p align="center">Wave amplitude - peak</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">Trend of the highest concentration of samples in the subintervals of a wave.</p>

Probabilistically, the high concentration of samples in a population is at its peak, towards the median of the population. Thus, due to the probabilistically high concentrations of samples in smaller and smaller intervals of a wave, the peak will occupy a smaller and smaller proportional subinterval within the population. This characteristic can demonstrate an approximately flat universe in its distribution. In subintervals this feature can create so-called black holes, which can be seen in more detail in the full paper.

###### Gravitational force

As the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the entangled pairs of a population tend to increase, their arrangement in a three-dimensional coordinate system will follow a diagonal reference between these three axes, as shown in Figure below. The points X1 and X2 were mirrored in the X and Z coordinates to make it easier to observe that raising the Z axis also raises the X or Y axis, regardless of their minimum probabilistic points. The dashed lines show the most probable paths to the A and B intervals. Thus, when a part of the interval is at its maximum midpoint (X and/or Y axes) the probabilistic tendency is that it receives fewer samples than the part of the interval that is at its minimum midpoint. This spiral effect is more noticeable the larger an interval and its quantity of samples, as the more probable and stable these paths will be.

</p>
<p align="center">Probabilistic reference line for distribution of a population in a three-dimensional plane.</p>

Each interval or subinterval (wavelength) has its own reference line. Just as within a meter there are centimeters, millimeters, etc., within an interval and subinterval there can be numerous other subintervals, as shown in Figure below.

<p align="center">Intervals and reference lines</p>

</p>
<p align="center">Spirals at different intervals and their reference lines.</p>

The gravitational force is not a force itself, but an aspect of the probability distribution of new samples towards the median of the population, according to the central limit theorem. This probabilistic direction causes waves to have a probable path to follow within the population, that is, the peak of the samples in the population or the peak of the largest wave in the population. Similarly, they also make the samples within a subinterval have a probable path to follow, that is, the peak of the samples in the subinterval (peak of this wave). These sample peaks are usually the most easily observable part of a wave, since they occupy a not-so-small area, as shown in Figures below.

<p align="center">Gravitational force</p>
<p align="center">
<img width="60%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_gravitational_force.jpg">
</p>
<p align="center">Gravitational aspect - the probabilistic direction of the distribution of new samples within an interval.</p>

It is also possible to notice in the image above that the area of an interval grows quadratically, since the jump caused by the entanglement of the waves and the probability distribution of the samples tends to maintain an equivalent growth in the pairs that form a wave. This aspect configures the inverse square law, where, in the case of gravity, the closer the objects, the greater the probabilistic chances of new samples of the smaller object heading towards the larger object (since the larger object tends to be the peak of wave - the probabilistic direction within the wave). Thus, for being within a smaller square area and, consequently, having less possibility of movement, it ends up increasing the chances of these objects approaching with a much smaller amount of logical moments. On the other hand, the more distant the objects, the larger the area, the greater the positioning possibilities and the more logical moments are needed for the approach, featuring less attraction. Probability can also drive away more rarefied objects that should be further away from the denser and more easily observable part of a wave, as in the case of helium gas, for example. The distribution of new samples in the rarefied intervals is slower than in the denser intervals (otherwise they would not be rarefied), so these dense particles receive more samples in a shorter amount of time, occupying the front of the less dense particles.

Figure below shows in its first example that wave 1, which could be a satellite, can rapidly approach wave 0 as new samples are distributed within the entire interval. The second example shows that the impulse the satellite receives when placed in orbit causes its wave to have a more uniform probability distribution (this uniform growth is facilitated by the low surrounding density, further away from the probabilistic peak - 1 sample in 100 is more relevant than 1 sample in 1000), where the part of the wave in blue is closer to the population median and has a growth or displacement equivalent to its lower wave, which keeps it constant. The third example is a better look at the second example, for ease of understanding, where wave 1 is defined by the spiral around the circular object representing the probabilistic peak. Perhaps the distribution of the samples at the peak, which is larger and the wave more uniform caused by the impulse (speed), can facilitate the understanding of the advance of atomic clocks on satellites. With this example it is also easier to see that the speed of light is not constant, what happens is that the light wave is so much smaller that the part of the wave that provides the speed is quickly undone, making it practically constant.

<p align="center">Gravitational aspects of a system - orbit.</p>

###### Electromagnetic force

The electromagnetic force is not a force itself, but an aspect of the entanglement of waves that intensifies at intervals or wavelengths with low entropy and with the spatial approximation (reduction of differences in the X, Y and Z axes) of these intervals.

When intervals have low entropy, their approximation makes the wave pairs of one interval very similar to the wave pairs of the other interval, which makes many of these pairs viable for wave entanglement to finding more ideal pairs in the other interval and vice versa. In this way, a rearrangement occurs between the intervals through wave entanglement, and this rearrangement makes these intervals more equalized (low entropy).

The blue lines in the figure below show where the exchange of wave pairs by wave entanglement is most frequent, that is, where the waves are most probable to be similar. This is why magnets try to rotate to connect when they are face to face with the same pole. The gray line shows connections that occur in a much smaller number.

###### Antimatter

When an interval tends to concentrate its samples toward the median, which is the probable direction according to the central limit theorem, it is called matter. Antimatter is the opposite, when an interval tends to concentrate its samples in the direction opposite to the median.

Merging or summing the opposite intervals would make them a symmetric interval, that is, it would not be in any direction. The figure below shows one population with its samples concentrated toward the median and another with its samples concentrated toward the interval boundaries.
