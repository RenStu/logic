# ‚ôæÔ∏è Logic, Logic Only - a [theory](#download-the-full-paper) about everything (overview)

According to the online English dictionary [Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/logic), the word logic refers to:

1. The system and <u>principles of reasoning</u> used in a specific field of study;
2. The <u>relationship and interdependence of a series</u> of events, facts, etc;
3. Necessary connection or outcome, as through the working of <u>cause and effect</u>.

The word logic, in its essence, fits perfectly with the definition of nothing - [NOT BEING]. Logic is centered on change and change is centered on that which [IS NOT], since that which [is] (being), cannot cease to be in order to transform. Change requires that at some point something ceases to be what it was in order to be transformed. In [Palmer (2020)](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/parmenides/) Parmenides, the philosopher of the unity and identity of being, says that continuous change is the main characteristic of [NOT BEING]. For Parmenides the [being] is one - singular, eternal, ungenerated, and unchanging.

In this duality, existence is based on logic, which [IS NOT - NEGATES ITSELF], while [is - being] illogical, immutable and non-existent. In this way, [being] limits existence by defining the non-existent, the immutable and the illogical while [IS NOT] *ad infinitum*.

## [Axioms](#axioms-of-primordial-logic) of primordial logic

<p align="center">Primordial Logic analogy</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Article/sections/images/primordial_logic_representation.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Line used to represent and validate the concept of primordial logic.</p>

In Figure above, the straight-line analogy is used to facilitate reasoning. Based on this Figure, the following observations ***(axioms)*** can be extracted in relation to the points **0**,  **1** and the **interval** between them:

- **Point 1 - [1,1]** - It is illogical, as it is the unfractionated total of the straight-line, in this case the primordial premise of the logic [NOT BEING] was not met.

- **Point 0 - [0,0]** - It is illogical, since it is a null point incapable of denying itself. All logic or sublogic (logical fraction) must continue to deny itself, since this is the primordial  premise of logic. Logic [IS NOT] in its essence, primordially.

- **Interval - ]0,1[** - The logic is only possible in the fractional representation of the line, that is, between the interval of the points 0 and 1. A fraction of the line denies being the line, since it is only a part of it. Subintervals, in the same way, are also capable of infinite negate themselves, guaranteeing the primordial premise of logic (negation of itself) in the interval and its subintervals.

## [Theorem](#theorem)

Primordial logic (negation of self) creates infinite logical expansions. A logical expansion is analogous to a universe. The first logical moment is the beginning of one of these expansions, but there are infinite possibilities of negation of the first logical moment, which reveals infinite logical expansions.

<p align="center">First logical moment</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Article/sections/images/first_logical_moment.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Fractionated line in two intervals representing the first logical moment.</p>

In Figure above the joining of the dash to the straight line is the representation of a logical negation (logical moment). From the negation of the logic in [be] arise these two logical subintervals or two sublogics (intervals of the straight line). In this first logical moment, the segment in blue represents the negation of the logic in [be] the illogical whole (the straight line).

<p align="center">Initial logical moments</p>
<p align="center"><img width="55%" src="/Article/sections/images/third_logical_moment.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Example of the first three moments of an expansion.</p>

- **First logical moment** The negation of the primordial logic to itself, subdivides it into two units, two sublogics. Although these parts have different proportions, they express the same amounts of points or possibilities of change, since they are representations of the primordial logic, which *ad infinitum*. The fractional part in blue represents the proportion of the logical negation to its unity.
- **Second logical moment** It is generated by the negation of the two primordial sublogics fractionated in the first logical moment, that is, the second logical moment is a negation of the first. In the impossibility of these sublogics continuing to negate themselves, even for a brief instant, would make them unable to negate their two units of the whole and consequently to make it [be]. The fractional parts in blue represent the proportion of the logical negation to their respective units.
- **Third logical moment** It follows from the negation of the second logical moment, just as the second logical moment follows from the negation of the first, and so on.

Based on the [axioms of primordial logic](#axioms-of-primordial-logic), the following theorem is discriminated: If the parts of the subintervals are subparts of the entire interval, then these subparts summed are part of the entire interval.

Thus, in Figure below, the negation of the first logical moment negates [being], while the subnegations of the other logical moments are subparts that subnegate [being], so these subparts only negate [being] when added together or unified according to the first logical moment.

In Figure below the representation of the first and second logical moments from Figure above can be seen as logical units.

<p align="center">Example of the first two unified moments of an expansion.</p>

The unity present in the negation (first logical moment) and in the logical subnegations (other logical moments) is the characteristic that corresponds to the central axis of the central limit theorem. This theorem states that the sample distribution of a population approaches a normal distribution as the sample sizes increase, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This is especially true for sample sizes greater than 30. A simple test that demonstrates this fact is the rolling of unbiased dice. The higher the dice roll number, the more likely the graph will look like the normal distribution graph [(GLEN, 2019)](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/normal-distributions/central-limit-theorem-definition-examples/).

The blue arrows in the graph below (range 99.99% of the total samples close to the median), will be getting closer and closer to the center of the graph proportionally. Although the its amount increases, the proportion it has in (total samples) decreases. The purple arrows in the graph represent the (total samples). This graph represents 20 runs (100 samples to 2000 samples), with an increment of 100 samples in each run. That is, this theorem reflects a concentration of samples towards the median of the population, ***a probabilistic path***.

This work will treat the words logical moment as the unified logical moment from now on.

## What is nothing?

The logical essence [NOT BEING] is analogous to an abstract constant, that is, its infinite negations and subnegations transcend time. All these infinite negations take  place in the absence of time. The inability of logic to negates itself, even for a small interval, would make logic [be] illogical in that interval, which would break the primordial premise of logic, [NOT BEING]. Logic is like an algorithm composed only of a self-executing constant, a infinite and generalized recursion.

It is simpler to visualize this generalized and infinite recursion by imagining a horizontal bar  **‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ‚ñÖ** . This bar is formed by infinite black vertical slices or lines. So there are infinite ways to negate the first logical moment and each infinitesimal slice of the bar will be the beginning of a different sequence or expansion. When determining any of the slices for the first logical moment, immediately all other slices of the population (in the left and right ranges of the chosen slice) are different expansions for the second logical moment, and so on. In other words, expansions are generalizations, and there is no slash range that has not already been negated for any logical moment.

This generalized infinite recursion in the absence of time is the best definition of a constant, the best definition of constant, which according to the English online dictionary [Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/constant), is something that repeats itself continuously, uninterruptedly and permanently, something unalterable.

The experience of time is conducted by the consciousness, a specific and non-generalized expansion. Time is not a quantity related to the simultaneous nature of this generalized and infinite recursion, but rather by the order or sequence of each specific expansion, which is nothing more than the observation of the order of the changes of each logical moment of the expansion. This order of each logical moment only makes sense in particular expansions, because when generalized the primordial logic [NOT BE] is a transcendent constant that mirrors or represents the infinite possibilities of a probabilistic n x n matrix.

## What are waves?

Probabilistically, the distribution of new samples from a population tends to concentrate more samples toward the median of the population as the frequency of samples increases in this direction. However, the distribution of these samples with uniform growth frequencies is infinitesimal compared to the random possibilities of this growth. Thus, the tendency of these growth frequencies toward the median, together with the very low (infinitesimal) probability of this growth being uniform, leads to frequencies in the waveform.

<p align="center">Waveform</p>
<p align="center"><img width="50%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_waves.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Wave pattern inferred by the trend of this distribution with higher frequencies towards the population median and very low probability of uniform growth of these frequencies.</p>

The most similar samples in terms of frequency and distribution are the samples that are part of the same wave. They are non-overlapping, opposite frequencies that complete each other.

Probabilistically, the two complementary parts of a wave tend to be at approximately equal distances, equidistant from the median, but this is not a rule and the complementary parts of a wave may be at different distances from the median. The phenomenon of parity of the parts of a wave is called ***wave entanglement***.

Intervals with similar temporal frequencies and spatial distributions are intervals formed by the same ***probabilistic unit***, that is, intervals that have the same probabilistic scenario or context at a given logical moment. Being in the same probabilistic scenario (probabilistic units), these intervals have their samples in the same space-time scenario, which is called space-time lattice and is formed by the largest probabilistic unit in the population (all the samples in the population intermediated by the median).

These entanglements form smaller waves, similar to the largest wave in the entire interval, usually entangled by the population median.

<p align="center">Smaller waves</p>
<p align="center"><img width="50%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_subconscious.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">The wave pattern forms smaller waves similar to the pattern created by largest wave in the entire interval.</p>

The jump is a reordering done by wave entanglement, as the samples of the entangled pairs are no longer equivalent with the addition of new samples from one side of the pair. The jump occurs on one side of a pair of waves and is a reordering, that is, both the part of the interval that has just received the new sample must better match the intended interval for the jump, as well as the reverse.

Larger waves are formed by adding their new samples, and can form new subintervals. The meeting or separation of two entanglements does not entail a new entanglement. Thus, larger waves are also formed through the inclusion (vigor of entanglement) of smaller waves already entangled when the areas of these waves are partially or totally overlapping.

The length and amplitude of waves establish a quantity-per-interval or unit relationship. These units are established by wave entanglement.

In large intervals with many logical moments, a smaller proportional discrepancy of wave amplitudes is observed. This characteristic is related to the larger number of logical moments and possible subintervals that can more easily compensate and neutralize the probabilistic unevenness of the interval. The larger the intervals, the more balanced they grow towards the population median (probabilistically). More complex intervals with this feature can represent, for example, the universe, then galaxies, stars, planets, etc.

<p align="center"><img width="10%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_space_subconsciousness.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Smaller wave discrepancy at large intervals.</p>

At smaller intervals and with many logical moments, a greater proportional discrepancy of wave amplitudes is observed. In these intervals smaller object systems can be observed. The smaller the intervals are, the more unbalanced they will grow towards the population median (probabilistically). More complex wave systems with this feature can represent, for example, the atom, which is very small, present in huge quantities, and the particles orbiting its nucleus (electrons) are much more distant from it. This greater discrepancy is strictly linked to the reduced size of these intervals, making them receive these new samples in a less uniform and unbalanced way, which makes the follow-up of their subintervals to their peak or to their reference line less accurate (the spiral becomes wider, elongated and misshapen due to less uniformity in its correction frequency). Spiral and orbits can be seen in more detail in the subsection on Spiral and orbit.

## What is time?

Time is the addition of new logical moments between existing moments as the self-negation of primordial logic proceeds. The changes are cumulative and as the number of logical moments increases, the less relevant each new moment within the conscious interval will be. One in a hundred is more relevant than one in a thousand.

<p align="center">Time</p>
<p align="center"><img width="55%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_time.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Progression of time as logical moments advance.</p>

Each population has a different order in its sequence and it is this order that gives rise to the logical quantity called time. It is this order of the universe that will give the notion of what happens before or after, that is, the past, the present and the probabilistic future prospections.

Another important factor when observing time is that, probabilistically, intervals closer to the population median will have a larger addition of new samples in their intervals. On the other hand, intervals far from the population median will have a smaller addition of samples in their intervals. This phenomenon of temporal observation provided by the probability of the population distribution avoids the twin paradox [(PERKOWITZ, 2013)](https://www.britannica.com/science/twin-paradox).

The ability to compare or distinguish the order of changes in a sequence of samples is the logical ability of an observer, the observer of time (past and present).The speed of this observation is given by the range that the observer is able to compare, that is, how quickly the observer is able to distinguish small changes (few samples - few logical moments) will make it realize that larger changes take longer (many samples - many logical moments).

The logical ability to make probabilistic prospections, within the logical limitations of the observer and based on the probability of distribution of the observed interval or subinterval, is the essence of thinking and, therefore, of life. These prospections are based on the probability of distribution of each interval (in the direction of the interval) and, therefore, are related to pattern detection and future probabilistic possibilities.

***More details about the Observer and life section can be found in the [full paper](#%EF%B8%8F-download-the-full-paper).***

## What is space?

Each new sample is time as well as space (movement and change). Each new sample added within an interval or subinterval will make it to move according to the distribution of its new samples. Every subinterval when entangled arises at the base of its upper interval. If the interval has no upper interval it will appear at the base of the plane. Then, the addition of new samples in this subinterval or interval that has just arisen will make it to rise in its upper interval or plane, and this is the path of all entanglement that has no subintervals. However, the environment may not be rarefied, which makes this movement difficult. So in Figure below an interval is shown that does not yet contain subintervals, so its rise will be centralized if its samples are evenly distributed or with a centralized peak, or it will be skewed to the right or left as the higher concentration of samples is on one side (it is more common for the concentration of samples to be towards the median of the population).

<p align="center">Interval without subintervals</p>
<p align="center"><img width="10%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_space_plan_nosubinterval.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Moving an interval without subintervals.</p>

A subinterval that is born within its upper interval is born fully synchronized with this upper interval, that is, the samples of the subintervals are also samples of the upper interval, they are shared samples, according to the vigor of their entanglements, as seen in the subsection of Entanglement. In Figure below, the sum of the motions of the subintervals of a higher interval moves that interval with a given direction and speed, which also carries with it those smaller subintervals that are part of it, even though these subintervals may diverge and leave the higher interval at a given moment. In this way, the movements of the smaller waves were the movement of the largest wave of the population, where its direction and speed are predominantly of the majority, usually the peak, notwithstanding the movement of the minorities. And like a block, the movement of the largest wave leads to the smaller ones, which are parts of it, even though some of these smaller waves have their own movement and can escape at a given moment by divergence in their directions from the direction of the majority.

<p align="center">Spatial distribution and movement of subintervals and population interval.</p>

In Figure below, the sample density of a population is shown, where pairs tending to the same probabilistic distribution are placed side by side and represented in histogram form. The formation of these pairs comes from wave entanglement.

By plotting the spatial dimensions of the graph of Figure above on a 3D distribution graph and distributing their endpoints (neglecting their volumes and possible internal points), something like a spiral is obtained (like eddies in water or air), even on very small data volumes (few logical moments), as in Figure below. The points tend to move in a spiral shape approximately.

###### Gravitational force

The gravitational force is not a force itself, but an aspect of the probability distribution of new samples towards the median of the population, according to the central limit theorem. This probabilistic direction causes waves to have a probable path to follow within the population, that is, the peak of the samples in the population or the peak of the largest wave in the population. Similarly, they also make the samples within a subinterval have a probable path to follow, that is, the peak of the samples in the subinterval (peak of this wave). These sample peaks are usually the most easily observable part of a wave, since they occupy a not-so-small area, as shown in Figure below.

In Figure below it can also be seen that the most easily observable part is slightly to the right at the peak of the wave. This wave tends to move up and to the right, in a diagonal direction to the peak of its upper interval. 

<p align="center">Gravitational force</p>
<p align="center"><img width="50%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_gravitational_force.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Gravitational aspect - the probabilistic direction of the distribution of new samples within an interval.</p>

It is also possible to notice in the image above that the area of an interval grows quadratically, since the jump caused by the entanglement of the waves and the probability distribution of the samples tends to maintain an equivalent growth in the pairs that form a wave. This aspect configures the inverse square law, where, in the case of gravity, the closer the objects, the greater the probabilistic chances of new samples of the smaller object heading towards the larger object (since the larger object tends to be the peak of wave - the probabilistic direction within the wave). Thus, for being within a smaller square area and, consequently, having less possibility of movement, it ends up increasing the chances of these objects approaching with a much smaller amount of logical moments. On the other hand, the more distant the objects, the larger the area, the greater the positioning possibilities and the more logical moments are needed for the approach, featuring less attraction. Probability can also drive away more rarefied objects that should be further away from the denser and more easily observable part of a wave, as in the case of helium gas, for example. The distribution of new samples in the rarefied intervals is slower than in the denser intervals (otherwise they would not be rarefied), so these dense particles receive more samples in a shorter amount of time, occupying the front of the less dense particles.

###### Electromagnetic force

The electromagnetic force is not a force itself, but an aspect of the entanglement of waves that intensifies at intervals or wavelengths with low entropy and with the spatial approximation (reduction of differences in the X, Y and Z axes) of these intervals.

When intervals have low entropy, the total or partial overlapping of their areas facilitates the reordering of their entangled pairs, and an example of this can be the overlapping of an electron's area with the photonic clouds of other electrons or atoms. This reordering is an attempt to equalize these waves into a single low-entropy wave, which also makes it feasible to exchange many of these pairs for those of the non-entangled virtual cloud (virtual cloud of non-entangled samples, usually around the peak of the interval or subintervals, according to the subsection of Entanglement), which may result in the approximation of these waves due to this reordering.

The blue lines in the figure below show where the exchange of wave pairs by wave entanglement is most frequent, that is, where the waves are most probable to be similar. This is why magnets try to rotate to connect when they are face to face with the same pole. The gray line shows connections that occur in a much smaller number.

## Spiral and orbit

As the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the entangled pairs of a population tend to increase, their arrangement in a three-dimensional coordinate system will follow a diagonal reference between these three axes, as shown in Figure below. The points X1 and X2 were mirrored in X and Y coordinates to facilitate the observation that even at the bottom of the spiral the interval continues to add samples, albeit in smaller amounts than when going up to the top of the spiral. The dashed lines show the most probable paths to the A and B intervals. Thus, when a part of the interval is at its maximum midpoint (X and/or Y axes) the probabilistic tendency is that it receives fewer samples than the part of the interval that is at its minimum midpoint. This spiral effect is more noticeable the larger an interval and its quantity of samples, as the more probable and stable these paths will be.

The continuous motion in a rarefied environment also helps in the formation and maintenance of the spirals. As the samples are added to the subintervals their velocities tend to increase towards the reference line, and because this addition is not uniform (varying between peaks and valleys) and the motion is approximately continuous the subintervals can drift or slide from one side of the reference line to the other.

<p align="center"><img width="45%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_space_spiral_reference_line.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Probabilistic reference line for distribution of a population in a three-dimensional plane.</p>

Each interval or subinterval (wavelength) has its own reference line. Just as within a meter there are centimeters, millimeters, etc., within an interval and subinterval there can be numerous other subintervals, as shown in Figure below.

<p align="center">Intervals and reference lines</p>
<p align="center"><img width="30%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_space_spiral_underlines.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Spirals at different intervals and their reference lines.</p>

###### Orbits

Orbit can be defined in this study as the concept of the spirals plus the orientation of a probabilistic peak (gravity) instead of the reference line of the spirals, only.

Systems that orbit as described earlier (in spiral - oriented by the reference line) are systems or intervals in which their peak is subdivided into subintervals and do not form a center of gravity, that is, all subintervals of the peak are not concentrated in one point of the system, thus orbiting the reference line of the interval. Probably galaxy clusters and superclusters are examples of this orbit. The spiral orbit (oriented by the reference line) is not restricted to large systems, this orbit is a feature that can happen in any size of interval.

Another type of orbit is defined when the subintervals that orbit the peak of the wave (which represents approximately 99.9% of the samples in the interval) decrease their orbit speed as they move away from the peak. In Figure below the columns of the histogram in blue represent the peak of the wave. This decrease in velocity occurs gradually as these gray intervals move away from the peak of the wave, thus receiving a smaller amount of samples decreasing their acceleration. The solar system is possibly an example of this type of orbit. Atomic orbits may also resemble this type of orbit due to the differences in energies between the layers structured by the jumps.

<p align="center">Orbits of the subintervals outside the wave peak</p>
<p align="center"><img width="40%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_elliptical_orbit_system.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">The subintervals decrease in speed as they move away from the peak of the wave.</p>

Yet another type of orbit is defined when the subintervals that orbit the peak of the wave maintain a constant average velocity regardless of the distance from the peak. This occurs because these subintervals are also part of the wave peak in blue, as shown in Figure below. Thus, because these subintervals remain in orbit within the 99.9% subinterval of the wave, their velocities do not decrease. This 99.9% of the wave is most easily visible part, therefore, the observed part of the galaxies, probably. Perhaps this feature is also responsible for the rings of planets.

<p align="center">Orbits of the subintervals inside the wave peak</p>
<p align="center"><img width="40%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_circular_orbit_system.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">The subintervals maintain their speed as they move away from the peak of the wave.</p>

As stated in the subsection of space, a new sample in a subinterval moves it and its upper intervals. Also new samples in the upper interval move the lower intervals, as they are fractions of the same wave. Even in a dense environment, intervals can move normally through the movement of their upper intervals (which are composed of the movement of their subintervals ‚Äì the position they occupy within their upper interval) in rarefied environments. In this way, a lower wave will remain in the upper wave when its velocity is less than the peak velocity of the upper wave and its path is not opposite to the upper wave's path. The movement of the upper wave drags its subintervals, which with lower probabilistic speeds will continue to move within its upper wave, because even with lower speeds they are dragged by the movement of the upper wave, which is also composed of the movement of its subintervals.

Doubling the amount of samples in an interval will not definitely double the speed of an interval, as it have twice as many samples to move, leaving the velocity unchanged. However, probabilistically, the greater the number of samples of a wave, the more these samples will be towards the population median and the less relevant the contrary samples become, which makes the probabilistic speed of wave peaks higher than the speed of their subintervals. This is not a rule and a subinterval may have a velocity greater than the peak of its upper wave or its movement may be contrary to the movement of the peak of the upper wave, causing it to naturally exit the gravitation of its upper wave (and this occurs more easily with very small and fast intervals favored by its movement in a rarefied environment due to its size).

###### Dark matter and dark energy

The intervals naturally move away with increasing speeds because they receive more samples towards the reference line or peak of the wave of their upper intervals and because they move in a rarefied environment.

Spirals can occur without the need for a concentrated wave peak, but when there is such a concentration in the wave peak, orbits can occur within or outside of 99.9% of peak samples, resulting in orbits that maintain their average velocity constant when away from the peak (within 99.9%) or orbits that decrease their velocities when away from the peak (out of 99.9%).

Therefore, dark matter and dark energy are neither matter nor energy, but probabilistic aspects of the distribution of samples in a population that resembles the normal distribution.

## Antimatter

When an interval tends to concentrate its samples toward the median, which is the probable direction according to the central limit theorem, it is called matter. Antimatter is the opposite, when an interval tends to concentrate its samples in the direction opposite to the median.

Merging or summing the opposite intervals would make them a symmetric interval, that is, it would not be in any direction. The figure below shows one population with its samples concentrated toward the median and another with its samples concentrated toward the interval boundaries.

<p align="center">Populations with their opposite sample concentrations</p>
<p align="center"><img width="40%" src="/Article/sections/images/consciousness_concentration_of_opposite_samples_within_range.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Populations distributed in opposite directions.</p>

## Black Hole

The area of an interval grows as new samples are added into the population and with the addition of other already entangled intervals, as shown by the upper right subinterval in Figure below. However, intervals that receive a large amount of samples within the population tend to form more and more subintervals at different levels, which contracts the occupied area of these intervals (because of the wave entanglement from the smaller subintervals sustaining these approximately quadratic areas) as shown by the purple and blue subintervals in Figure 38. So this relationship of the size of the interval with its amount of samples and their subintervals is the aspect that can help describe the so-called black holes, where the peak of the wave will occupy a smaller and smaller proportional subinterval within the interval of the wave, even with an increasing concentration of samples. These peaks are often found from the middle to the front of an interval or system (the core or peak of the system).
